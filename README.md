<h2>About the Project</h2>
The purpose of the project is to visualize different pathfinding algorithms and to demonstrate the situations in which they perform best.
<p></p>

It includes the following algorithms for visualization:
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Search

The visualizer allows you to add obstacles by clicking or holding the mouse, and a maze can be generated to visualize different scenarios for the algorithms.
